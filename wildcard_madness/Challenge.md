## Challenge
Alphabetic characters are overrated... Try to print the flag using only a single alphabetic character! 

To run the challenge use the connect script: `./connect`. DO NOT run the python script directly; it will not work.

- Hint: Wildcards are amazing! 
- Hint: Using grep to find the flag preface 'flg{' is a good idea.
