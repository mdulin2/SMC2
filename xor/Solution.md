# Solution: 

XOR has a property that, given two of the values, the other value can be figured out. In this case, the key is known and the ciphertext is known. So, we should be able to find the plaintext for the value by reversing the processs. 

The easy way to do this is to swap the key with the ciphertext, then give the key as the input text. This will output the ciphertext.
