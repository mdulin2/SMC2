## Scoreboard
- The scoreboard was built using CTFd. 
- The `SpokaneCTFBlankScoreboard.zip` can be loaded into CTFd (using the import feature) to load the CTF. 
	- Note: Lots of things will be different... Such as IPs and stuff in use. Lots of modification is needed 
	- Note: Some of the flags are INCORRECT and were discovered to be this way on the scoreboard during the contest. These will not be backported on this file to be correct.
