## Solution 
- This audio file is giving off morse code. 
- The audio file gives the following pattern: 
	- ..-. .-. --- -- | - .... . | -. --- .-. - .... 
	-  F    R   O  M    T  H   E   N   O   R  T  H 
- 'FROM THE NORTH' is the flag for the contest
- It is likely that students will get tripped up at the TH in THE. THis because there is a single -, then 4 dots, which can also be interrupted as a 6. If students are stuck on this, then tell them to listen very carefully for the pauses.
