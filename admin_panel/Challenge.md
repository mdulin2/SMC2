## Challenge
Most of the time, when trying to break into banks and such, you are left without the source code :( However, in some cases (such as open source) you may find the source code for an application! This time, we have found an administrative panel with some limited functionality. By reviewing the source code can you find the vulnerability in it? :)   

In order to solve this challenge please talk to a judge and explain: 
- What this vulnerability is? 
- A potential payload (exploit) for it.
