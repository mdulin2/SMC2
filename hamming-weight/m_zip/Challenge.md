## Challenge 
- m_zip is the new up and coming zipping sofware! Use this to zip things :) 

- In order to win this challenge, create a file or folder in /flag on the server. 
	- Submit your zips by ``./send_zip.sh <IP> <zip_file_name>``.

Usage: 
	- zipping: 
		- ./m_zip zip <zip_file_to_create> <file_1> <file_2> .... 
	- unzipping: 	
		- ./m_zip unzip <previously_created_zip> <output_folder>
		
Hint: 
	- This bug appeared in Winrar within the last year.
	- Reverse engineering the file format is a good starting point.
